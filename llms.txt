# Prompt Parent

> A portable, secure devcontainer for parents who code in 15-minute windows.

Built by [@meimakes](https://x.com/meimakes) — also writes [The Undercurrent](https://theundercurrent.dev), a newsletter on dev tools and workflows.

## What This Is

An open-source VSCode devcontainer (.devcontainer/) you drop into any project. Clone, open, code — zero config. Includes:
- Claude Code + GitHub Copilot (sandboxed, no host access)
- 1-second auto-save (walk away anytime)
- Persistent bash history across rebuilds
- Git pre-configured
- Day/night theme switching
- Smart file nesting and exclusions

## Why

Parents who code in stolen minutes can't spend 12 of those minutes on setup. This eliminates environment configuration entirely and isolates AI tools from host credentials.
